# Launch the Dashboard

View project results interactively in a web browser.

## Start the Dashboard

```{eval-rst}

.. code-block:: console

   $ stride view my_project

   Dash is running on http://127.0.0.1:8050/

   * Serving Flask app 'STRIDE'
   * Debug mode: off
   WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment. Use a production WSGI server instead.
   * Running on http://127.0.0.1:8050
   Press CTRL+C to quit   
```

then CTRL-click on or copy-paste the address into your browser.

This opens an interactive dashboard where you can:

- Compare and browse scenarios
- Compare results across years, sectors, and end uses
- View, customize, and export pre-populated visualizations (e.g., bar chart, load duration curve, timeseries, summary statistics)

## Specify a Port

```{eval-rst}

.. code-block:: console

   $ stride view my_project --port 8080
```

## View Without a Project

Launch the dashboard without a project:

```{eval-rst}

.. code-block:: console

   $ stride view
```

Projects can be loaded and color palettes can be managed from the sidebar.

## Configure Max Cached Projects

By default, STRIDE keeps up to 3 projects open simultaneously. Each open project holds a DuckDB connection,
and on BlobFuse2 FUSE mounts too many concurrent connections can cause errors.

You can configure this limit via three methods (highest priority first):

### CLI Flag

```{eval-rst}

.. code-block:: console

   $ stride view my_project --max-cached-projects 5
```

### Environment Variable

```{eval-rst}

.. code-block:: console

   $ STRIDE_MAX_CACHED_PROJECTS=5 stride view my_project
```

### Settings UI

Open the sidebar, click **Settings**, and adjust the **Max Cached Projects** value in the General section.
This persists the setting to `~/.stride/config.json`.

Valid range is 1–10. The default is 3.
